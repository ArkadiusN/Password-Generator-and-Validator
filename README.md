# Password-Generator-and-Validator
A simple approach to generate the password for the user and validating its strength.
It asks the user how long the password should be and how many numeric and special characters it should contain.
Once this input is given the approperiate password is generated and user can take it. 
The Validator works based on counting all special/numeric characters and based on that decided how strong the password is.
